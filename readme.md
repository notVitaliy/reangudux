# rea[ng]udux

> A component wrapper for rendering `react` components in an `angular@>1.5` app.

This wrapper assumes `ng-redux` as a peer dependency. A `redux` store is used as the single source of truth for both angular and react. This allows for much simpler inter-framework communication with minimal developer overhead.

This wrapper is highly influenced by `react2angular`.

## Features

* Inter-framework communication
* Out-of-the-box `ui-router` support
* Simple and consistent API
* All `reangudux` code can be placed in 1 file

## Usage

### [Example App](https://github.com/notVitaliy/reangudux-sample)

## TODO

1. Write ~better~ some docs.
